### ATGC count in DNA sequence.py  
This program counts the number of As, Ts, Gs and Cs in the DNA sequence.  

### Calculate GC content.py  
This program calculates the GC content in a given DNA sequence.  

### Calculate hamming distance.py  
This program calculates the Hamming distance between two DNA sequences. Hamming distance is used to measure the difference between two DNA sequences of the same length. It quantifies the number of positions at which the corresponding nucleotides differ.  

### Calculate molecular weight of a protein sequence.py  
This program calculates the molecular weight of a protein sequence from the molecular weight of each amino acid in the protein, which can be estimated from the translated protein sequence.  
### Count open reading frames in RNA.py  
This program estimates the open reading frame in an RNA sequence. It identifies and quantifies the potential protein-coding regions within a given RNA sequence. ORFs are stretches of nucleotides within an RNA sequence that have the potential to be translated into a protein.  

### Organize sequences and headers in FASTA file.py  
This program reads through a FASTA file containing headers and sequences and organizes both of them into keys and values in a dictionary, respectively.  

### Reverse complement.py  
This program outputs the reverse complement of a given DNA sequence.  

### Transcribe DNA to RNA.py  
This program transcribes a given DNA sequence into an RNA sequence that can be translated further into an amino acid sequence for protein formation.  

### Translate RNA to protein.py  
This program translates an RNA sequence into its respective amino acid chain.  

### These are all helpful programs in bioinformatics and can be modified depending on usecase. Some of these programs can be bypassed altogether using the BioPython module in Python. However, it always helps to be able to code the actual thing!
